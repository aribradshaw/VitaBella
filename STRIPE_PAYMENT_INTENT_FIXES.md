# Stripe Payment Intent Fixes

## Issues Found

Comparing your existing code with the proper Stripe payment intent event you provided, several key issues were identified:

### 1. Missing Payment Method Configuration
**Problem**: The original code didn't explicitly configure payment method types and options.

**Solution**: Added proper payment method configuration:
```typescript
payment_method_types: ['card', 'us_bank_account'],
payment_method_options: {
  card: {
    request_three_d_secure: 'automatic',
  },
  us_bank_account: {
    verification_method: 'automatic',
  },
}
```

### 2. Missing Setup Future Usage
**Problem**: No `setup_future_usage` was configured, which is crucial for subscription payments.

**Solution**: Added `setup_future_usage: 'off_session'` to the payment intent update.

### 3. Missing Description
**Problem**: Payment intents didn't have a proper description.

**Solution**: Added `description: 'Subscription creation'` to match the expected format.

### 4. Webhook System Disabled
**Problem**: The webhook endpoint was completely disabled, meaning Stripe events weren't being processed.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive webhook handler that processes:
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` 
- `payment_intent.requires_action`
- `invoice.paid`
- `invoice.payment_failed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `checkout.session.completed`

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/api/stripe/subscriptions/route.ts`
- Added payment method types and options to subscription creation
- Added payment intent update with proper subscription settings
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 2. `/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`
- Re-enabled webhook processing
- Added comprehensive event handling
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Required Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are configured:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... # or sk_test_... for testing
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Get this from your Stripe webhook endpoint
```

## Expected Payment Intent Structure

Your payment intents should now match this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "pi_xxx",
  "object": "payment_intent",
  "status": "requires_payment_method",
  "amount": 22800,
  "currency": "usd",
  "customer": "cus_xxx",
  "description": "Subscription creation",
  "setup_future_usage": "off_session",
  "payment_method_types": ["card", "us_bank_account"],
  "payment_method_options": {
    "card": {
      "request_three_d_secure": "automatic"
    },
    "us_bank_account": {
      "verification_method": "automatic"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

1. **Test Subscription Creation**: Create a new subscription and verify the payment intent has the correct structure
2. **Test Webhook Processing**: Send test webhooks from Stripe dashboard to verify events are processed
3. **Test Payment Flow**: Complete a payment and verify all events fire correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Webhook URL**: In your Stripe dashboard, set your webhook URL to `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook`
2. **Add Event Types**: In Stripe dashboard, ensure you're listening for all the events mentioned above
3. **Test in Development**: Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local development environment
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check both your application logs and Stripe dashboard for successful event processing

## Security Notes

- Webhook signature verification is enabled and required
- All environment variables should be kept secure
- Consider adding rate limiting to webhook endpoints in production

            <h2>Summary & Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of information Vita Bella and its affiliates (collectively, “Vita Bella,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) may collect, how we use such information, and with whom we share it. Except as explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect and use about you from our website located at www.vitabella.com, any other U.S. websites on which we post this Privacy Policy, and when you otherwise interact with us (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. Except as provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by us outside of the Services, including on any other website operated by Vita Bella or any third party, or data collected outside of the Services by Providers, the Medical Groups, the Labs, or the Pharmacies. It also does not apply to the information practices of any third party, including third parties you may communicate with off the Services, or third parties you connect with through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Services.</p>
            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Services, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you hereby consent that we may collect, use, and disclose your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If any term in this Privacy Policy is unacceptable to you, do not use the Services. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.</p>
            <p>Note: Vita Bella operates the Platform but does not provide medical services and is not a medical group. Any telehealth consults obtained through our Services are provided by independent medical provider groups, including, but not limited to, Vita Bella Medical Group, P.A. (collectively, the “Medical Groups”), which engage with a network of United States-based health care providers, including nurse practitioners and doctors (each, a “Provider”). The Medical Groups and all Providers are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information in accordance with federal and state law. The Medical Groups and their associated Providers process your health information in accordance with the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices, the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices shall prevail.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices, you may not use or otherwise access the Services.</p>

            <h2>Protected Health Information</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> This is a summary of our privacy practices, full details on our privacy practices are available on our website and on the new patient registration form.</p>
            <p>When you set up a User Account with Vita Bella, you are creating a direct customer relationship with Vita Bella that enables you to access and/or utilize the Services. As part of that relationship, you provide information to Vita Bella, including but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and certain transactional information that are not “protected health information” or “medical information.”</p>
            <p>However, in using certain components of the Services, some of the information we collect may constitute “protected health information” (“PHI”) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). While Vita Bella is not a “covered entity” as defined in HIPAA, one or more of the Medical Groups and its Providers, the Pharmacies, the Labs and/or other health care providers engaging with you through our Services may be a “covered entity” or “business associate” under HIPAA and therefore subject to HIPAA, and Vita Bella may in some cases be a “business associate” of a Medical Group, Pharmacy and/or Lab. Please note that HIPAA does not necessarily apply to an entity or person simply because there is health information involved, and HIPAA may not apply to your transactions or communications with Vita Bella, the Medical Groups, the Providers, the Pharmacies and/or the Labs. To the extent Vita Bella is deemed a “business associate” however, and solely in its role as a business associate, Vita Bella, may be subject to certain provisions of HIPAA with respect to PHI. In addition, any medical or health information that you provide that is subject to specific protections under applicable state laws (collectively, with PHI, “Protected Information”), will be used and disclosed in accordance with such applicable laws. However, any information that does not constitute Protected Information under applicable laws may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy. Protected Information does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
            <p>The Medical Groups and its affiliated Providers have adopted a Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices that describes how they use and disclose PHI. By accessing or using the Services to interact with a Medical Group and/or Provider, you acknowledge that you have received and agreed to the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices from your Medical Group and/or Provider(s).</p>
            <p>Where Vita Bella collects, uses, and discloses Protected Information on behalf of your Medical Group or Provider, such processing on behalf of your Medical Group or Provider shall be consistent with the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices and as permitted in Vita Bella’s agreements with the Medical Groups or Provider, except to the extent you have expressly authorized additional uses and disclosures. We may use PHI for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations, including to communicate with you, to provide requested services, to provide information to your Medical Groups or Providers, pharmacies, and insurers, to obtain payments for our services, and to communicate with your Medical Groups or Providers, pharmacies, and benefits program. We may combine your PHI with other information about you, including information from other sources, such as from your Medical Groups or Providers, pharmacies, insurers or benefits program, in order to maintain an accurate record of our users. We may use your PHI to contact you for any services or products offered by Vita Bella or the Medical Groups.</p>

            <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
            <p>We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as necessary for our legitimate business interests, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.</p>

            <h2>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
            <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We use encryption technology for information sent and received by us. However, transmitting information via the Internet is not completely secure, so although we take steps to protect your information, we cannot guarantee complete security. You share information with us at your own risk.</p>
            <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

            <h2>Third Party Information</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy does not address and we are not responsible for the practices or policies of any third parties using, accessible through, or linked from the Services, including Providers, the Medical Groups, the Pharmacies, the Labs, the manufacturer of your device and other IT hardware or software, and any third-party app or website to which our Services may contain a link. These third parties may gather information from or about you. We have no control over the privacy practices of these third parties and make no representations about them. We encourage you to review the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices and the privacy policies of each website and application you visit and use.</p>

            <h2>Do We Collect Information From Minors?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
            <p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of eighteen (18) without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect information for individuals under the age of 18 (including, for children under the age of 13, “personal information” as defined in the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) without the verifiable consent of that child’s parent or guardian. If we learn that we have received any information for an individual under the age of 18, we process and delete that information as required by applicable law. If you are aware of a child providing personal information to us without parental consent, please contact us at <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a>.</p>

            <h2>What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
            <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a>.</p>
            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

            <h2>Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

            <h2>Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information, however, Vita Bella does not currently operate in California.</p>
            <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

            <p>We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be “selling” of your personal information.</p>

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
            <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
